rbpu - Red Bull Pic Up Locator App
====
Red Bull Pic Up was a promotion run by Red Bull where packages were hidden around college campuses with 3 free Red Bull drinks along with a code which could be used to further your chances of getting the final prize.

I was more concerned with getting free Red Bull drinks other than the final prize so I wrote this app to first notify me when a new pic up was added to the website since they were only sorted by distance and not chronologically.

I later realized that the site used geolocation to sort the results by distance and also returned the distance from said point.
I then took this information to do some trilineration to find the exact location of the pic up.
